- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RexC2I
- I'm a 28 year old former labor worker turned student of O3DE and other gaming engines and have founded my own studio with a few friends.
- Writing this in Oct of '21 will be my first time using Github but I'm already enjoying it.
- In the future I hope to update this with lots of cool stuff.
- You can reach me on Discord @ Rex#0003
